# User Story Ideas:
- <X> as the research coordinator, <Y> I want the participant to be able to input demographic details, <Z> for data tracking that can assist in future features
- <X> as the developer, <Y> I want all tracked actions saved as object literals with an iterative naming scheme, <Z> to make it easier to organize and call data to display it
- <X> as a focus group participant, <Y> I want the user experience to be pleasant but free of distractions while I give my input, <Z> because that's what I want
- <X> as the purchasing officer, <Y> I want all the options selected to come from the same source, <Z> because that makes my job easier
- <X> as the product inventory planner, <Y> I want all options to come from 5 categories and to be labeled with their category, <Z> so I can have more precise data
- <X> , <Y> , <Z> 
- <X> , <Y> , <Z>

# First Steps
- Create a layout that displays three styled images
    - bordered boxes, inline
    - images need max-height and max-width
    - within max-h/w, size will be auto
    - for now, black backround in the box
- Import assets
- Make function to display 3 new images
- Make function to accept click and resulting action to display new images

# Later Steps
- Transformations or animations on boxes, one for clicked, one for hover, one for not clicked
-
